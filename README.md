# WeaponTool

I will create an application that will facilitate the connection between weapon shops and the clients that want to buy weapons for self-defence.

Admin side: The shop owner can manage the list of his products so people that want to buy them will have a minimum knowledge about them. He has the possibility to add, remove or update the standard list of weapons and their prices.

The application allows users to create and manage their own lists of weapons that they own. By clicking on each element you can see the details of the weapons such as status, ammo that is compatible with it,  description, how often you should clean it etc. The list allows you to add, remove and upate the weapons as you wish from the list created by the admin.
